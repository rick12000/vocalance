Task: Evaluate and refactor the attached service code to simplify and streamline its logic.

Goals:
Simplify logic: Do more with less. Reduce code size without sacrificing key functionality.

Remove:

Redundancy and repetition

Dead/zombie code

Hardcoded values

Prefer: Readable, maintainable, and flexible code over complex or over-engineered solutions.

Trade-off philosophy:
Prefer a 90-line codebase that delivers 90% of the value over a 180-line codebase that delivers 100%. Simpler wins unless the extra complexity is justified.

Coding Guidelines:
Avoid over-planning for rare edge cases.

Use try/except and loops only when necessary (e.g., for robustness in event-driven flows).

Centralize:

Logic and operations

Type definitions with informative, reusable structures

Component reuse: Favor existing utilities or patterns if available.

Integration Awareness:
Maintain compatibility with other services, connectors, and the UI.

If dependencies or connectors can be streamlined, do so.

Don't break existing integration or external contracts.

Final Output:
Refactored code

Brief summary:

Major simplifications made

Any functionality intentionally removed (and why) — this is discouraged and should be justified
