## ✨ Core Features

### 🎤 Advanced Speech Recognition
- **Multi-Engine STT Support**: Dual-mode processing with Vosk and Open AI Whisper engines for ultra fast command execution and good transcription accuracy.
- **Low Latency**: Voice commands execute instantly thanks to smart optimizations (dictionary pruning, predictive word recognition, disambiguation timeouts).

### 🤖 AI-Powered Dictation
- **LLM Integration**: Local large language model processing of dictation outputs to correct grammar, rephrase in a custom tone, etc. at source.
- **Privacy-First**: All AI processing happens locally, no data leaves your device.

### 🎛️ Comprehensive Command System
- **Custom Command Management**: Create, edit, and manage voice activated hot keys through intuitive GUI.
- **Mouse Control**: Voice-controlled clicking, scrolling, and cursor movement
- **Command Parametrization**: Scroll down three times by saying "scroll down 3".
- **Custom Sounds**: Train your own non-verbal sounds to trigger any hot key or command.

### 🖱️ Intelligent Screen Interaction
- **Visual Grid System**: Overlay numbered grids for precise screen targeting, that learn where you click most often.
- **Marks**: Navigate to locations on screen by name.
